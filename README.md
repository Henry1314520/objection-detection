Features:
Behavior Detection: Detect student behaviors (e.g., attentive, distracted) using the YOLO model.
Image Input and Output: Users can upload classroom photos, and the system returns annotated images.
Behavior List: Displays detected behaviors and their confidence scores.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Gradio, providing an intuitive web-based interface.
GPU Acceleration Support: Automatically utilizes GPU acceleration if CUDA is available.

 (Tech Stack)
Deep Learning Framework: YOLO V8(You Only Look Once)
User Interface: Gradio
